# EXISTING PAGE RESTRUCTURE WORKFLOW
## Extract, Analyze, Restructure, and Enhance Existing Pages

### üîç PHASE 1: CONTENT EXTRACTION & ANALYSIS

#### Step 1: Component Inventory
```markdown
**Page Location:** [file path]
**Existing Components:** 
- [Component1.tsx] - [brief description]
- [Component2.tsx] - [brief description]  
- [Component3.tsx] - [brief description]
- [etc...]

**Current Structure:** [List current flow]
```

#### Step 2: Deep Content Mining
**Extract from each component:**
```
COMPONENT: [ComponentName]
TEXT CONTENT:
- Headlines: [list all titles/headlines]
- Body Text: [extract all paragraph content]
- CTAs: [button text, links]
- Labels: [form labels, badges, tags]

MEDIA CONTENT:
- Images: [URLs, alt text, descriptions]
- Videos: [URLs, descriptions]
- Icons: [icon types, purposes]

DATA CONTENT:
- Statistics: [numbers, percentages]
- Lists: [feature lists, benefits, etc.]
- Tables: [any tabular data]

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
- Forms: [field types, validation]
- Buttons: [actions, destinations]
- Charts: [data, visualization type]
```

#### Step 3: Content Analysis & Intent Discovery
**AI Analysis Questions:**
- **Page Purpose Discovery:** What is this page actually trying to achieve?
- **Content Quality Assessment:** What content is high-value vs. redundant?
- **User Journey Analysis:** How does current content guide users?
- **Conversion Path Assessment:** Where are the friction points?
- **Content Gaps:** What's missing for optimal user experience?
- **Redundancy Detection:** What content is duplicated or unnecessary?

#### Step 4: Content Categorization & Prioritization
```
HIGH-IMPACT CONTENT (Keep & Enhance):
- [Content that directly serves main page purpose]
- [Unique value propositions]
- [Strong social proof elements]

MEDIUM-IMPACT CONTENT (Restructure):
- [Supporting information that needs better presentation]
- [Features/benefits that need clearer organization]

LOW-IMPACT CONTENT (Consolidate or Remove):
- [Redundant information]
- [Outdated or irrelevant content]
- [Poor-performing CTAs]
```

### üèóÔ∏è PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT RESTRUCTURE STRATEGY

#### Step 5: Content Flow Redesign
Based on extracted content, design optimal user journey:

**Original Flow Analysis:**
```
Current: [Section A] ‚Üí [Section B] ‚Üí [Section C] ‚Üí [etc.]
Issues: [What doesn't work about current flow?]
```

**Optimized Flow Design:**
```
New: [Strategic Section 1] ‚Üí [Strategic Section 2] ‚Üí [etc.]
Rationale: [Why this flow serves users better]
```

#### Step 6: Component Restructure Architecture
```tsx
// NEW COMPONENT STRUCTURE

// ENHANCED HERO
Content Source: [Original component + best content]
Enhancements: [What Assembly DNA features to add]
Goal: [Improved first impression + clearer value prop]

// RESTRUCTURED MAIN SECTIONS (2-4)
Section 1: [Combined content from original components X + Y]
Section 2: [Reorganized content from original component Z]
Section 3: [New section combining scattered content]

// CONSOLIDATED FEATURES/BENEFITS
Original: [Scattered across multiple components]
New: [Unified presentation with better UX]

// ENHANCED SOCIAL PROOF
Content: [All testimonials, stats, logos consolidated]
Presentation: [Interactive, visually appealing format]

// OPTIMIZED CONVERSION SECTION
Original CTAs: [List current CTAs and their performance]
New CTA Strategy: [Consolidated, strategic placement]
```

#### Step 7: Content Enhancement Strategy
```
PRESERVE (70% of content maintained):
- [All key messaging and unique content]
- [Brand voice and terminology]
- [Important technical specifications]
- [Valuable social proof elements]

ENHANCE (Improve presentation):
- [Better visual hierarchy]
- [Clearer information organization]
- [Improved readability and scannability]

ADD (Strategic additions):
- [Missing trust signals]
- [Better transition content between sections]
- [Enhanced interactive elements]
- [Stronger conversion optimization]
```

### üé® PHASE 3: ASSEMBLY DNA INTEGRATION

#### Step 8: Visual Upgrade Strategy
```scss
// Maintain Brand Consistency
Existing Colors: [Extract current color palette]
Enhanced Palette: [Assembly DNA enhancement of existing colors]

Existing Typography: [Current font usage]
Enhanced Typography: [Assembly DNA hierarchy applied to current fonts]

// Apply Assembly DNA Patterns
Card System: [Convert existing content blocks to glassmorphism cards]
Gradient Effects: [Add gradient accents to existing elements]
Animation System: [Add entrance animations and micro-interactions]
Spacing Rhythm: [Apply consistent spacing system]
```

#### Step 9: Component Enhancement Checklist
For each restructured component:
- [ ] Content preserved and improved
- [ ] Assembly DNA styling applied
- [ ] Framer Motion animations added
- [ ] Interactive elements enhanced
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improved
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Accessibility maintained

### üöÄ PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION & OPTIMIZATION

#### Step 10: Development Priority
```
Phase 1: Core Content Restructure
- Extract and organize all content
- Create new component architecture
- Implement basic Assembly DNA styling

Phase 2: Enhancement Layer
- Add sophisticated animations
- Implement interactive elements
- Optimize conversion paths

Phase 3: Refinement & Polish
- Fine-tune animations and transitions
- Optimize performance
- Final testing and adjustments
```

#### Step 11: Quality Assurance
```
CONTENT INTEGRITY:
- [ ] All important original content preserved
- [ ] Brand voice and messaging maintained
- [ ] No broken internal references

USER EXPERIENCE:
- [ ] Improved content flow and navigation
- [ ] Better information hierarchy
- [ ] Enhanced conversion opportunities

TECHNICAL QUALITY:
